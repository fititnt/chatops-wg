# ChatOps _for non-DevOps people_ Working Group 2018/01
This working group aims to push something near of what is ChatOps culture to
outside a typical IT environment where people already work with DevOps and
already work with some sort of enterprise chat platform.

In addition to tools available for free and with advanced support to the
participants, we aim to enable them to focus on the human side. We try to make
other participantes waste less time on the technical implementation of
[intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) as one
way to automate boring work. We are also concerned about allowing material
that will enable them to promote and teach others in the future.

The active period of this working group will be just the first semester of 2018.

## Participants
Participants are invited directly or indirectly by the promoter [Emerson Rocha](https://github.com/fititnt).
These people can somehow collaborate with the group and/or already work in
some large organization or company/project which have public interest in be
more efficient.

Participation does not involve payment. If you are not invited but have
long-standing history in collaboration with open source, or act as a promoter
of change on gov, NGOs, or social enterprise, you can email me at
emerson@alligo.com.br.

<!--
This is a working group, whose participation is via individual invitation, and
the main subject is "ChatOps". 

Most of the participants are not typical developers using ChatOps in the IT
arena. And that's a good thing. I, [Emerson Rocha](https://github.com/fititnt),
believe that pushing this culture of automation into other areas and making
people more productive, and having more time and freedom to do more creative
tasks.

If there is no explicit extension, the active
deadline is during the first half of 2018.

The group is fostered by [Emerson Rocha](https://github.com/fititnt).
