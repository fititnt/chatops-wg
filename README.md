# ChatOps Working Group 2018/01
This is a working group, whose participation is via individual invitation, and
the main subject is "ChatOps". If there is no explicit extension, the work
deadline is during the first half of 2018.

Most of the participants are not typical developers using ChatOps in the IT
arena. And that's a good thing. I, [Emerson Rocha](https://github.com/fititnt),
believe that pushing this culture of automation into other areas and making
people more productive, and having more time and freedom to do more creative
tasks.
